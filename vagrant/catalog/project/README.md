# Free and For Sale Catalog
## Full Stack Nanodegree Project 3

This is a server side web app that maintains a catalog of items that users can post for free or for sale. Users can login with their Google accounts to add items to the catalog. They can also edit and delete their items, but not others'. Signed in and public users can contact the seller via the 'Contact seller' button under each item.

To run the app:

1) If no database currently exists in the directory, run `python database_setup.py`
2) Once the database is initialized, run `python main.py` to start the server
3) Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` or `http://0.0.0.0:5000` to begin using the app
